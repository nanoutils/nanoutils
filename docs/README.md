# nanoutils

Tiniest JavaScript utils library

## Inspiration

We support nano-hype in JavaScript and want to create as much nano-things as possible.  
So we're starting a challenge - write Ramda clone where no one method will be over 1KB size.  
More nano's for the God of nano's!

## Basic ideas

* **Functional style**. FP is cool, isn't it? :sunglasses: So we'll add some Ramda methods too.
* **No ES6 features**. We don't use Babel to save support in older browsers and save a status of nano-library.
* Use **methods composition** only if it won't greatly increase the size of method

## Can I use it in my project?

It's production-ready, but still has following drawbacks:

* No documentation (will be available soon)
* No TS/Flow types

But as it's a Ramda-supportive, you can see both docs and types here: [Ramda docs](https://ramdajs.com/docs/)
